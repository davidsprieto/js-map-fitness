    &copy; Base Project Created by
    <a class="twitter-link" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman">Jonas Schmedtmann</a> in the
    Udemy Course: The Complete JavaScript Course. This project is not entirely my own. I followed along and completed this project module               portion to use for my own learning and deeper understanding of JavaScript. The original project is called Mapty. However, I renamed the project     to Map Fitness and implemented many additions and features on my own by reading the Leaflet documentation and from what I believe provides for      a better user experience.
